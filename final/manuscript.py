Can Lizards, Birds, and Trees Help to Design Future Cities? Innovative Scenarios for Multispecies Living
1	Objective
Design better future cities by incorporating imaginative contributions of nonhuman urban dwellers. 
2	Abstract [200, actual 213]
This study investigates the future of urban forests in Melbourne, Australia, focusing on large, old trees and their inhabitants. Climate change, aging populations of trees, and urban densification accelerate forest decline. Without mature trees, which take centuries to develop crucial features for habitat, wildlife populations face significant loss.
Frameworks for scenarios attempt to imagine better futures but are limited by anthropocentric approaches that prioritize human benefits. Incorporating theories of ecological justice, we develop an alternative framework that considers nonhuman lifeforms and ecosystems as stakeholders and participants. To do so, we develop a spatially explicit model that simulate how resources are distributed across woodland baselines, current conditions at three urban sites, and future trajectories. Using analysis of tree lifecycles, we develop two contrasting scenarios over 180 years: current practices for management versus interventions in design that prioritize the needs of multiple species.
Results show that critical resources like hollows can increase by x% toward baseline levels within 30 years through innovations including artificial hollows, bracing for senescent trees, and utility poles adapted as artificial canopies. We verify findings through quantitative metrics, three-dimensional distributions of resources, and visualizations. This research introduces a new framework for participation by nonhuman life in building scenarios and demonstrates how ambitious visions can guide decisions about cities during multiple crises.
3	Introduction: [1150, actual 1158]
3.1	Designing Beyond the Status Quo
States have pledged to achieve a vision of "Living in harmony with nature" by 2050 (IPBES, 2019). Multiple large-scale assessments show rapid environmental change means achieving such visions demands substantial changes in human and nonhuman individuals, institutions, societies, and cultures (Folke et al., 2021; Mastrángelo et al., 2019). Yet, research on practices for transformative change lags behind research on the nature of the problems (Sharpe et al., 2016). Cities represent critical sites for such transformation, concentrating both environmental impacts and opportunities for human-nature relationships. While urban ecologists recognize that cities contain significant biodiversity and approaches like green and blue design and reconciliation ecology demonstrate their potential to support thriving ecological communities (Croeser et al., 2022), current interventions like nature-based solutions continue to prioritize human benefits over ecological needs (Mastrángelo et al., 2019). In response to accelerating environmental crises, many conservationists challenge the incremental changes produced by such approaches and call for expanded transformative options (Wyborn et al., 2021).
Recent research exploring transitions advocates expanding the range of alternative futures (Cork et al., 2023). Multiple disciplines recognize that expanding imagination can challenge established beliefs and narratives that limit possible futures, as necessary solutions may currently seem unimaginable (Neuhoff et al., 2023). To develop capacities for such transformation, institutions developing frameworks like the Nature Futures Framework call for example narratives (Durán et al., 2023). Researchers focused on urban transformations highlight scenarios as a key method to develop these narratives (Mansur et al., 2022), as scenario planning can integrate scientific evidence and forecasting while enabling creative and critical thinking about the future (Tourki et al., 2013).
In dense, highly modified environments such as cities where there is minimal area for classic habitat enhancement, sustainability transitions involve complex power dynamics (Mastrángelo et al., 2019). The concept of the more-than-human city acknowledges that those with least power - nonhuman beings, entities, and lives - continue to suffer (Heitlinger et al., 2024) . Such work challenges anthropocentric bias of current city trajectories and argues that urban futures should neither isolate nature nor prioritize human needs (Clarke et al., 2019). Yet, futuring approaches exploring such frameworks remain underexplored (Neuhoff et al., 2023).
While the future is unpredictable and stakeholder goals remain diverse, speculative visions serve as powerful tools for exploring potential trajectories through prototypes and scenarios, expanding the range of alternative outcomes while coordinating collective action (Edwards & Pettersen, 2023). Design approaches can empower scenarios not only through building specifications but also through activism and imagining speculative worlds (Fry, 2009). In response, this article develops more-than-human scenarios. We use speculative design approaches that both inspire novel solutions and generate actionable outcomes."
3.2	Gap
In developing such scenarios, we identify four key gaps in current knowledge and practice: 1) lack of frameworks that incorporate nonhuman needs, 2) absence of ecological baselines for comparison, 3) failure to consider creativity by empowered communities, and 4) limitations of models in accounting for nonhuman capabilities.
3.2.1	Lack of frameworks 
Removing distinctions between humans and nonhuman needs in design processes introduces complex ethical considerations (Parker, Soanes, et al., 2022). Design inherently redirects trajectories towards better, more desirable futures involving judgments on aesthetics, value prioritization, and trade-offs. Yet humans typically entrust themselves with defining these futures.
Despite improved frameworks such as design for biodiversity, sustainability, and nature-based solutions, decision-making about desirable futures typically remains within human political forces and expertise. Scenario frameworks seeking to broaden urban futures acknowledge a gap in scenarios frameworks that value nonhuman lifeforms and ecosystems beyond human well-being, preferences and interest (Mansur et al., 2022) The criteria for success, even in progressive approaches, prioritize human benefits (Washington et al., 2017). At best, such outcomes constrain envisioned futures by overlooking those outside human societal imagination. At worst, they confine solutions to human perceptual scales, proving insufficient for ecological processes spanning centuries to millennia and leading to extinction debts (Hahs & McDonnell, 2014).
3.2.2	Lack of baselines
Intact ecological systems and their evolved histories can serve as benchmarks for designing multispecies futures. Yet anthropogenic change obscures ecological baselines. While typically referring to precolonial states (Gibbons et al., 2010), available baseline data often reflects already degraded environments. The concept of shifting baselines illustrate how each generation accepts progressively degraded environments as normal (Klein & Thurstan, 2016)  complicating the establishment of success metrics.
3.2.3	Failure to consider creativity by empowered communities
Futures studies increasingly recognises the need to develop communal imagination to think beyond prevailing narratives (Neuhoff et al., 2023). Recent initiatives demonstrate benefits of empowering human communities in climate and energy transitions [Demsec, EU Horizons].
Including nonhuman lifeforms introduces greater complexity. While nonhuman innovations in environmental engineering and niche construction (Odling-Smee et al., 2003) can benefit both nonhumans and humans (Rutten et al., 2024), more-than-human collectives involve multiple worldviews, information-processing modes, needs, and goals (A. Holland & Roudavski, 2024). For instance, increasing proximity to nature can lead to conflicts between human communities and wildlife (Bhatia et al., 2020). Research into sensory and behavioural ecologies reveals how profoundly different nonhuman perspectives can be, potentially requiring significant changes to human aesthetic preferences and accepted risk levels.
3.2.4	Failure of models to account for nonhuman capabilities
Multispecies futures must therefore develop communicative systems that empower the contributions of more-than-human collectives. While nonhumans cannot participate in traditional stakeholder workshops, some political theorists recognize that they can express agency through behaviours and signals (Bendik-Keymer, 2020; Dryzek, 2000). Numerical modelling offers practical pathways to connect these nonhuman signals with human institutions and design processes (Rutten et al., 2024). Yet models in current anthropocentric frameworks presume limited nonhuman capabilities and struggle to capture their contributions.
Models can create tangible artifacts serving as concrete examples of possible futures to aid thinking and discussion. Yet the IPBES expert working group on scenarios and modelling identifies the lack of models that can generate positive visions rather than simply predict trends as a key gap [REF]. Challenges include handling various data types, incorporating local knowledge, maintaining cross-domain agility, and communicating complex results.
3.3	Opportunity
In response, this article considers the provocation that nonhumans are part of urban communities and that current stakeholder teams building scenarios do not correctly represent them. It provides an account of more-than-human stakeholder teams that can collectively create visions of cities. Recent advances in biology and political ecology have made it possible to develop more-than-human scenarios. Computing can support numerical assessments of resulting alternatives.
4	Methods [2300, actual 2514]
4.1	Case Study Choice [~300, actual 380 words]
This study investigates urban forest futures in Melbourne, Australia. Ecologists recognize urban forests as the dominant habitat in many cities, but climate change, aging trees, and urban densification are leading to an accelerated decline (Endreny, 2018). Our work focuses on large, old trees and their arboreal dwellers, as these trees require centuries to develop essential habitat features but are commonly targeted for removal (Ikin et al., 2015). Without large old trees, insects, bats, birds, and beneficial bacteria lose their habitats, which younger, smaller trees cannot provide (Lindenmayer & Laurance, 2016).
Design and management decisions that incorporate the needs of trees and arboreal dwellers are crucial in response to ongoing habitat loss and degradation. Originally dominated by river red gums (Eucalyptus camaldulensis), sheoaks (Allocasuarina spp.), yellow box (Eucalyptus melliodora), and wattles (Acacia spp.), Melbourne’s urban forest now relies heavily on aging exotic species, including elm (Ulmus), in decline under climate stress. This transformation presents urgent challenges, as the City of Melbourne (2012) (2012) projects a 27% - 44% reduction in tree numbers within the next 10 to 30 years, necessitating up to 200,000 replacement trees in the broader metropolitan region to maintain canopy cover [REF].
To understand such challenges, this study examines three distinct urban contexts: a historic boulevard lined with centuries-old elms, an inner-city residential street experiencing rapid densification, and a dense central business district. These sites exemplify how human-centric urban policies harm multispecies communities. For instance, management practices focused on perceived safety risks of branch fall result in trees being removed just as they provide crucial arboreal habitat resources (Ikin et al., 2015). Additionally, infill dwelling encouraged by sustainability policies leads to the loss of trees in private yards as suburbs densify (Brunner & Cozens, 2013). Ecological studies from other Australian cities predict the complete loss of old trees in as little as 30 years (Le Roux et al., 2014).
This case also occurs within a broader effort to support large old trees in urban areas and their arboreal dwellers. Initiatives include Council's Greening Your Laneways and Rooftop Gardens projects (City of Melbourne, 2017) as well as innovative design proposals, including artificial habitat structures on light poles (A. Holland & Roudavski, 2024), 3D-printed nestboxes (Parker, Roudavski, et al., 2022), and bioenvelopes on building facades (Canepa et al., 2022). This integration into an existing multispecies context makes the case study valuable for testing multispecies design approaches.
4.2	Scenario and Model Design [~2200 words]
We use a modified TRACE approach (Grimm et al., 2014) to document our model and scenarios. We provide a summary here and detailed version in the Supplementary Materials
4.2.1	Problem Formulation [200, actual 220 words]
The 'more-than-human turn' in environmental humanities provides context for our work. Work in Indigenous ontologies, Actor-Network-Theory and New Materialism challenges traditional human-nonhuman distinctions (Belcourt, 2020; Bennett, 2009; Latour, 2007). Multispecies and interspecies justice frameworks advance this theoretical foundation by offering a pragmatic frame to recognize the experiences and balance the needs of human, nonhuman, nonsentient and even nonliving entities in future environments (Celermajer et al., 2020). 
Our central hypothesis is: nonhuman contributions can generate scenarios which are unattainable to humans on their own. We break this down as three components: 
1.	Design of future environments can transcend conventional mitigation approaches to create more ambitious and rewarding outcomes
2.	These environments can be modelled within clear empirical and theoretical constraints
3.	Detailed observations of nonhuman entities can meaningfully inform scenario development, elevating their agency and needs within the design process
This research operates within the broader context of urban forest management and biodiversity conservation, engaging multiple stakeholders including urban planners, ecologists, arborists, local communities, and various species of flora and fauna. The primary aim is to explore maximum ecological potential through methods that deprioritize human needs while maintaining traceable connections between evidence and outcomes. While our approach permits broader extrapolations than conventional predictive models, we ground our work in supporting evidence including visual documentation, species distribution data, and quantitative metrics.
4.2.2	Model Description [277 words]
The model provides a spatially explicit framework to simulate above-ground arboreal habitat resources at any location in the City of Melbourne. It uses multi-resolution voxels to simulate distributions at woodland baselines, current site conditions, and future trajectories. 
We provide a summary of the model below and a full description using the ODD protocol (Grimm et al., 2020) in Supplementary Materials Appendix B. 
The model integrates three key components:
•	Arboreal resources linked to nonhuman stakeholders
•	Design interventions that enhance these resources
•	Generated resistance scores under tree canopies and other urban elements that inform where and how design interventions can be implemented
To simulate future trajectories, the model assesses at year intervals: 
(A) Tree Growth and Senescence:
Trees can:
•	Grow according to trunk growth rates
•	Trees approaching end of life expectancy enter senescence
•	Senescent trees either:
o	Age-in-place if site resistance is low
o	Get replaced with young eucalyptus if site resistance is high
(B) Possible Design Support: 
Senescing trees may:
•	Receive design supports, including:
o	Ground depaving and the creation of under-canopy habitat islands in low resistance areas (ie, street parking, laneways, and median strips)
o	Bracing exoskeleton supports in high resistance areas (ie. busy under canopy traffic)
o	Upgrades including 3D-printed nests, artificial bark, and epiphytes in tree canopies.
Senescent trees may also:
•	Progress to standing dead snags
•	Progress to collapsed trees:
(C) Further design interventions.
The model also searches urban elements capable of improving arboreal habitat resources, implementing:
•	Rewilding of larger ground areas 
•	Translocating snags to provide vertical habitat structures
Extension of the model also consider deploying:
•	Artificial trees on poles and streetlights. 
•	Bio-envelopes of rooftops and facades that can support lightweight and more intensive modifications.
Sub-models simulate possible distributions and quantities of resources across trees of different ages, management impacts, and design supports. 
4.2.3	Data Evaluation [385 words]
We use a multi-scale data integration approach to assess and model urban forest communities while accounting for multiple species' needs and mitigating human biases. 
Figure 2 shows how we integrate data across three hierarchical levels. 
Figure 1. A. Site assessment showing urban conditions affecting design interventions, where lower values (blue) represent areas more amenable to modification such as parking spaces and road medians, and higher values (red) indicate barriers such as major roads and building footprints. B.

Data sources include urban forest inventories, GIS data (roads, footways, tramways, powerlines, building footprints), lidar for building envelopes and tree canopies, and estimates of precolonial baselines. High-resolution laser scans of elm and eucalyptus trees, ecological surveys, and custom implementations for branch detection and senescence simulation inform resource distributions (Table 1 )

4.2.4	Conceptual Model Evaluation (692 words]
To assess scenarios, we examine multiple agents representing nonhuman lifeforms and ecological processes found in Melbourne’s pre-colonial woodlands and current urban forest. We use personas (Tomitsch et al., 2021) as a design device to represent such agents. Each persona embodies patterns of community relationships that may combine several genera or species, drawn from existing management documents such as City of Melbourne's Linking Nature in the City [REF].
We adapt the capabilities approach from ecological justice to develop measurable outcomes for scenarios. Originally developed for human development and later extended to animal welfare, this approach recognizes that considered entities require opportunities for fulfilling lives beyond economic indicators (Nussbaum, 2011). Because we understand urban woodland dwellers as participants in connected socio-ecological systems rather than as isolated individuals, we build on precedents in climate justice where the capabilities of ecological systems are central (Schlosberg, 2014). Accordingly, we consider extensions of this approach beyond its biocentric, individualistic, and sentient origins and position nonsentient lifeforms and ecological systems as  considered entities, community members, and stakeholders (Celermajer et al., 2020).
Capabilities are the real opportunities for individuals or entities to achieve what they value (B. Holland & Linch, 2016). Basic capabilities encompass fundamental survival needs including nutrition, hydration, thermal regulation, and freedom from pain. Intermediate capabilities include social interaction, exploration, and community engagement. Advanced capabilities include aspects such as autonomy, innovation, and adaptability, which contribute to long-term survival and system resilience. 
Our analysis considers a subset of capabilities related to niche and habitat. We focus specifically on above-ground arboreal habitat resources, considering resources as elements in an environment that a capability can convert into a benefit for an agent. We systematically sampled capabilities across:
1.	Organizational scales (individuals, families, communities)
2.	Temporal scales (spanning at least three generations)
3.	Capability levels (basic, intermediate, advanced)
We developed these capabilities through scientific evidence describing:
•	Sensory and behavioural ecologies
•	Life-cycle histories
•	Species-specific functional connectivity estimates
Table 1 operationalizes capabilities through specific examples drawn from key woodland species and their ecological relationships, including birds, reptiles, and trees.

We assess scenarios at five time points (t=0, 10, 30, 60, and 180 years). The 30-year timepoint aligns with common urban planning horizons (Liu & Wu, 2022), while the 180-year endpoint corresponds to the time required for eucalyptus trees to develop key habitat resources such as hollows (Gibbons & Lindenmayer, 2002). While this framework necessarily simplifies complex ecological processes, it provides a structured approach for using persona capabilities to guide scenario design and evaluation.
While this framework necessarily simplifies complex ecological processes, it demonstrates how persona capabilities can effectively guide scenario design and evaluation
4.2.5	Model Output Verification [147 words]
We assess woodland capabilities through systematic comparison of tracked criteria. To verify outputs, we compare four outcomes:
1.	Woodland capabilities in the past: Simulate resource distributions in precolonial woodlands (~300 years ago)
2.	Woodland capabilities in the present: Simulate current distributions
3.	Trending Woodland Capabilities: Scenario projecting outcomes if current management practices continue
4.	Positive Woodland Capabilities: Scenario considering outcomes with design interventions prioritizing persona needs
This comparison serves three key purposes:
•	Establishes an ecological baseline representing maximum habitat potential
•	Validates our ability to accurately model current arboreal resource distributions
•	Show that these scenarios positively compare with the existing trends/proposal
We also track how urban elements convert into supports for persona capabilities, quantifying the sequence of transitions between different types of use.
In the discussion, we evaluate the generative potential of this framework against others by comparing scenario-building teams, success criteria, ability to describe participants and conditions, and included time scales.
4.2.6	Model Analysis [190 words]
Rather than using standard protocols designed to verify predictive power, we focus on examining the generative potential of the output scenarios. 
To do so, we perform an additional step and generate visualizations. These show specific points in time and space in the 'positive' scenario. These images help reduce uncertainty by making explicit predictions about how resources might be distributed within a transformed urban fabric.
We compile these images using different techniques for generating structures and resources, each with distinct constraints and varying degrees of confidence regarding locations, boundaries, and quantities. To aid interpretation, we provide a table describing the ecological functions and underlying spatial constraint and uncertainties of different visual components in the images.
4.2.7	Model Output Corroboration [160 words]
To test the model's reliability, we focus our analysis on our main site (‘Parade’) with a constrained set of design actions, as this allows detailed examination of core model mechanisms and scenario potential. We then extend the approach to additional sites (‘City’ and ‘Street’) with more speculative interventions  and refer to these results in the discussion (Table 3).

5	Results [2100, actual 2260]
We show outcomes for the main site in the results. 
1.	Section 1 uses capabilities identified in the Methods to reconstruct evolved woodlands, establishing a baseline for future design comparisons.
2.	Section 2 develops scenarios that show how current and trending management practices at the site diminish woodland capabilities while also illustrating possibilities for restoring woodland capabilities through designs that go beyond current management strategies.
3.	Section 3 presents scenes that show instantiated perspectives going beyond conventional approaches. 
We demonstrate the utility of the model applied to further sites and conditions in the discussion.
5.1	Woodland Capabilities in the Past 
We first use these capabilities to simulate woodlands circa 1700, serving as a historical reference point before European settlement (Figure 2). 
 
Figure 2. Past Woodland Simulation: Top. Distribution of tree recruitment and succession stages in temperate eucalyptus woodland: recruitment phase (green, sprout; blue, mid-phase), maturing canopy (orange, large; pink, senescent), and decay pathway comprising standing dead snags (yellow), and remnant collapsed trees (cyan). Middle. Landscape-scale distribution of arboreal resources utilized by bird personas: tree hollows (pink), peeling bark (yellow), and perching branches (orange). Bottom. Spatial arrangement of resources supporting lizard personas: decomposing nurse logs (brown), dead branches (blue), and epiphytic vegetation (green).
The tree persona exhibits continuous regeneration through overlapping lifecycles. The loamy soil provides plenty of opportunities for seedlings to sprout. A robust cohort of 2,014 saplings and 255 mid-phase trees ensures ongoing canopy renewal. Mature phases are represented by 80 large trees and 80 senescent specimens, while the decay pathway includes 80 standing dead snags and 80 collapsed trees. Almost all trees complete their full lifecycle. This distribution enables the tree persona to fulfill its capabilities for growth, renewal, and decay across multiple generations.
The woodland bird persona benefits from extensive resources found in intact woodlands. Each large tree produces 9-20m³ of hollows for nesting, 309-807m³ of peeling bark forming sources of invertebrate prey, and 619-1,763m³ of perching branches for observation and rest. These features support essential bird capabilities including rearing young, socialising, and foraging. The total amount of these resources includes 12,105 tree hollows, 614,510m³ of peeling bark, and 2,716,985m³ of perching branches.
The ground-dwelling lizard persona can move through the entire woodland due to the complex ground-level environment created through intact woodland processes. Each mature tree contributes 155-236m³ of fallen logs for shelter. As these logs rot away, each tree's 118-379m³ of dead branches and 6-11m³ epiphytes renew this ground debris through branch fall and leaf litter. Collectively, the woodland provides 627,927m³ of nurse logs covering the ground, as well as 614,510m³ of dead branches, and 3,760 epiphytes that generate new volume of fallen biomass. Such distributions enable lizard capabilities for thermoregulation, predator avoidance, and exploration through connected habitat networks.
Together, these interconnected resources enable all three personas to express their full range of capabilities, from basic to advanced. We next use this baseline to compare different configurations of resources in the present and across future scenarios.
5.2	Woodland Capabilities in the present and future
Our next result describes outcomes for current conditions as well as trending and positive scenarios. 
 
Figure 3.Comparison of Trending and Positive scenarios. 
5.2.1	Current
Both scenarios begin along a 500m stretch of Royal Parade, where intensive management of 40 mature elm trees prevents natural habitat development. Although many trees are mature (>100 years), current practices remove dead and lateral branches. The site contains 120 parallel parking spaces (1,800m²) and six traffic lanes (9,000m²).
Individual large elms have canopy volumes of 224-787m³, representing 128,843m³ of potential habitat substrate if left unmanaged. Middle-aged eucalyptus in the adjacent park provide minimal resources due to intensive management. 
[X]% of the ground is paved, preventing new tree saplings from emerging. While [x]% is open space, [X]% of that is manicured grass. [X] square meters of paved surfaces >5m in width mean minimal amounts of peeling bark ([x]% of baseline), perch branches ([x]% of baseline) and hollows ([x]% of baseline) constrain bird capabilities.
5.2.2	Trending
The trending scenario considers outcomes if current management practices are continued.
By Year 10, many large elms reach their management-determined end of life. Only 14 large park trees and 51 large street trees remain. The overall look of the street remains similar, though 34 of the large street trees (67%) are in critical condition and scheduled for removal within ten years The street maintains its orderly appearance with remaining elms providing canopy.
At Year 30, almost all large elms have been removed, with only 25 large park trees and 2 large street trees remaining. Removed elm has been replaced with young eucalyptus trees. —there are now 77 medium park trees and 28 medium street trees. While local to the region, these young trees have smooth bark and upward-facing branches. Paving prevents natural regeneration. Most parking and all traffic lanes remain due to low trust for change. The canopy reduction increases local temperature. While orderly, the street is hot.
At Year 60, 4 older trees in the adjacent parkland are almost reaching the age they can provide resources, but concerns of overhanging branches and high canopy dieback prompt their removal. The urban forest is completely dependent on humans for regeneration.
By Year 180, only 5% of trees reach senescence due to early removal. The site remains dominated by young and middle-aged trees, with just 16 large park trees and 4 large street trees
6.2.3 Positive
The positive scenario considers management practices and actions that enhance woodland capabilities.
By year 10, changed management allows 15 senescing elms to develop complex canopies. Converting 40 parking spaces (600m²) to habitat islands enables less intensive management, with each supporting 3-4 young eucalypts and understory vegetation. This retains 409,853m³ of dead branches, 1,198,359m³ of perch branches, and 122,308m³ of peeling bark. An artificial mistletoe program establishes 823 epiphytes. The overall look remains recognizably a street, but accumulated ground resources expand lizard habitat to 45% of the site, up from 15% in the trending scenario. A 60% increase in perch branches and 40% increase in hollows means birds have more spaces to perch and nest. Diverse flocks begin appearing in senescent trees.
At year 30, increased wildlife builds public trust, enabling two traffic lanes (3,000m²) to be depaved. Twenty-five additional elms have entered late senescence, with 15 having died. Rather than being removed, 12 remain as standing snags (each 15-20m tall), providing approximately 127,735m³ of coarse woody debris (yellow canopies, Figure 3). Each snag supports 2-3 artificial hollow installations and 5m² of artificial bark surface area. Ten senescent elms in high-traffic areas (2,000m²) receive structural supports, retaining 20-40% of their canopy as dead branches.
The site contains 16,285 hollows, 8,367 epiphytes, and 842,304m³ of dead branches. Self-sown trees emerge in the 2000m part of the adjacent parkland reseeded with native grass (orange-brown colouring in Figure 3). Eight translocated dead elm snags serve as substrates for 24 artificial hollows and 40m² of artificial bark, while 30 young eucalypts establish alongside these features. 
The emerging ecosystem appears messy and challenging to many human observer.
By year 60, most road traffic is diverted and streets depaved. Thirty-five elms have completed their lifecycle. Twenty-five collapsed specimens contribute 135,817 m³ of coarse woody debris (blue canopies, Figure 3). Forty middle-aged eucalypts (30-40 years old) display smooth bark and vertical branches with minimal natural hollow development. [X] middle-aged eucalyptus trees are now late-stage. In their unmanaged state, they form hotspots of bird life, with [x] amount of peeling bark, [y] amounts of hollow, and [x] epiphytes. The material from 40 decomposed elm logs (approximately 501,462m³) has enriched 5,000m² of soil to a 30cm depth. The biomass generated by fallen logs, leaf litter and collapsed trees has made the soil deep, rich, and crumbly. Tree succession processes remerge.
At year 180, the final transformation stage shows 50 mature eucalypts (>150 years old) providing substantial resources. Human support such as artificial hollows, peeling bark sleeves and snags are no longer needed. Approximately 57,628 natural hollows, 3,299,764m³ of perch branches, and extensive peeling bark surfaces totalling 640,159m³ are the result of the eucalyptus trees entering their senescent phase. The self-sown trees are now entering late middle age. Deadwood is ubiquitous. The topsoil continues to grow, and fungi proliferate. The woodland now demonstrates ecological self-regulation, with natural processes maintaining habitat complexity with minimal human intervention.
We next show visualisations. 
5.3	Illustrative Visualisations 
To illustrate the transition from current conditions to the envisioned future, we present visualizations showing how resources interact and change over time. 
Figure 4 shows visualisations of senescing processes at the site at 10 and 30 years in the positive scenario.
 
Figure 4. Scenario visualisation. Top left (A), + 10 years: A senescent elm tree allowed to age-in-place. Top right (B), + 10 years: A rewilded section of the adjacent park. Bottom (C), +30 years: The same elm as in 4A, now retained as a standing dead snag.

We explain how to interpret each component to aid understanding of what the visualizations represent and their level of certainty (Table 2).
Table 4. Interpretation of visualization components.
Resource (Color)	Ecological Function	Spatial Distribution	Temporal Relations
Perch Branches (orange)	Perch locations	Exact location (branches >0.05cm radius)	+10 years: Still rare in the highly managed environment
+30 years: Increasing significantly due to senescing elms and snags retained-in-place after death
Dead Branches (blue)	Debris source	Exact location (branches >0.05cm radius)	Same progression as perch branches
Peeling Bark (yellow)	Invertebrate habitat	Statistical distribution	+10 years: Rare, supplied by artificial bark sleeve
+30 years: Still relatively rare as not supplied by elms but must be provided artificially
Hollows (pink)	Shelter	One hollow per convex volume	+10 years: Rare, supplied by artificial hollows as existing trees have filled hollows
+30 years: Still constitutes relatively small amount of biovolume, even after 30 years not enough formation so supplied by artificial hollows
Epiphytes (green)	Organic litter source	One per indicated region	+10 years: Rare, but supplied by mistletoe that can be installed in elms
+30 years: Increasing, but still supplied by humans
Fallen Logs (brown)	Ground shelter	Exact location from branch fall patterns	+10 years: Rare but increasing
+30 years: Significantly increasing, as fallen logs and collapsed trees are retained

Figure 4A shows a senescent elm tree aging in place. Although this specific tree does not exist at this location, we derived its form through geometric analysis of similar elm trees at equivalent life stages. We simulate senescence by identifying major branches from the trunk and calculating likely patterns of dieback (Figure 4A, white outline). Orange regions show perch branches, which we identify by analysing branches within 20 degrees of horizontal. Yellow regions represent artificial bark applications. Readers should interpret these yellow volumes as statistical proportions of total canopy rather than precise locations.
In Figure 4B, grey regions indicate possible rewilding boundaries based on our model's conversion of low-resistance areas like open space. Young trees appear in grey due to minimal resources, while positioned snags and logs provide interim habitat. 
Figure 4C shows the elm from 4A advancing 20 years. Each pink volume represents one hollow, predicted to occur within specific boundaries based on statistical distributions. The model positions these according to height restrictions and branch radius requirements. Green volumes similarly indicate regions containing individual epiphytes, while dead branches (blue) and fallen nurse logs (brown) come from precise geometric scans. We simulate the snag structure by removing small-radius branches from geometric models of large elms. The surrounding urban forest contains branches coloured grey to indicate absence of specified resources. Although the changes appear dramatic, much of the site has little resistance because vehicle movement and parking are the primary functions occurring there. Wide grassy road verges, car parking and duplicate car lanes account for X% of the area, meaning the model can fill the current site conditions without substantial loss to existing functions.
Our next image shows woodland processes visibly overriding human management (Figure 5)

 
 
Figure 5. Royal Parade at +60 years in the positive scenario. On the right, a young eucalyptus displays characteristic vertical branches and smooth grey bark, with limited orange perch branches, distinct from the horizontal spread of elm canopies. In the middle, a dead elm snag retains its major limbs, providing yellow artificial bark surfaces and supporting pink hollow volumes. On the left, a senescing elm contributes substantial blue dead limbs and hosts green epiphytes. Fallen elms (brown) contribute to ground habitat. 2,600m² of converted street parking provides space for these fallen trees and accumulated resources. Young and middle-aged eucalyptus trees grow among the elms, creating contrasts in form and texture. Artificial hollows and epiphytes installed throughout provide supplementary habitat.

 
The transformation began with converting underutilized space - road verges and car parking - inviting human dwellers to aesthetically accept small differences with negligible functional impact. This change has grown into substantial transformation. The removal of all traffic, including trams, allows the site to overgrow. Dead branches remain visible in trees, fallen wood accumulates on the ground, and vegetation grows in previously manicured spaces. Woodland processes begin to visibly override decades of intensive management.
For woodland stakeholders, benefits are substantial: lizards gain interconnected habitat across 85% of the urban fabric (versus 15% in trending scenario), birds access 33,251 hollows, and 40% of trees reach senescence (versus 5%). The 1,261,047m³ of fallen branches enrich soil and support diverse organisms. 
These changes demand significant human compromise through reduced vehicle access and modified transit routes. Large branches and accumulated resources challenge traditional aesthetics and maintenance approaches. However, the design maintains clear paths with structural supports ensuring safe pedestrian passage through this transformed landscape.
We continue with the discussion.

6.2	Designing beyond the status quo: directions for future research [1700, actual: 1836words]
This final section compares the capabilities approach we propose to show that it captures things that state-of-the-art frameworks do not find significant. Table 5 shows current approaches have significant limitations in addressing multispecies needs. 
Table 5. Comparison of frameworks for urban futures
Framework	Teams	Success Criteria	Limitations
Ecological modeling	Scientists	Useful predictions in conditions of uncertanity	Focused on predicting trends rather than generating novel possibilities
Ecosystem services	Human experts	Economic benefits	Limited timeframe
Justice-based	Human stakeholders	Equitable outcomes	Nonhumans not considered political agents
Wildlife inclusive	Multiple stakeholders	Net positive biodiversity	Success criteria prioritizes humans
Capabilities approach	Human + nonhuman	Community flourishing	Can be slow, costly, significant changes to human aesthetics

Ecological modelling, while useful for predictions under uncertainty, focuses on trends rather than transformative possibilities. Ecosystem services frameworks highlight trees' ecological, financial, and cultural values but remain constrained by economic thinking and short timescales of 25-30 years. Justice-based approaches emphasize equitable outcomes but typically consider only human stakeholders. Even emerging wildlife-inclusive and biodiversity-sensitive designs (Apfelbeck et al. 2020; Garrard et al. 2018), while considering species' lifecycles and historical conditions, ultimately prioritize human benefits.
To apply this theoretical framework to practical findings, we reexamine our three study sites, using them as devices to explore key aspects of the capabilities approach. The Parade site reveals how nonhuman capabilities can inform design processes, the City site shows how these contributions generate novel scenarios beyond conventional approaches, and the Street site illustrates practical pathways for implementation.
6.2.1	Enabling Nonhuman Contributions Through Capabilities [650]
How might nonhuman stakeholders have a greater say in decision-making? Our main site Parade demonstrates how the capabilities approach reveals nonhuman contributions and guides their incorporation into design processes.
Understanding the worldviews of others, human and nonhuman, is difficult. However, nonhuman behaviour and processes can serve as a form of political input. For example, male wall lizards mark favourable urban locations with femoral gland secretions, while blue-tongued skinks leave chemical trails to indicate preferred shelter sites. Elm trees demonstrate how centuries of growth can provide stable platforms even after death, informing both preservation strategies and artificial habitat design. Yet such actions present fundamental challenges since humans must translate and interpret their forms of expression.
The capabilities approach provides a framework to guide such translation. In human contexts, scenarios must consider participants' capabilities to mitigate biases [Mastrango ref]. For instance, climate initiatives use collaborative mapping exercises [REF] to link local knowledge with institutions and decision-makers. The use of translators to include migrant communities is another example (Elsawah et al., 2020).  In the Parade site, the combination of local site conditions, life histories, institutional processes and data collection practices create biases. These biases promote and reduce different physical structures that support specific capabilities. For instance, habitat structures such as hollows can be quantified in terms of volume and distribution. However, many birds use complex aggregations of perch branches in tree canopies that fall outside human perceptual scales. Because these are harder to observe, policies do not protect them, as observed in the Trending scenario. This prevents passerines (70% of bird species) from socializing, resting, and playing.
Our model demonstrates that certain capabilities can be measured and translated. While traditional urban forest assessments rely on 2D canopy analysis, the volumetric approach used here captures critical habitat features often invisible to humans. For instance, this method captures small green spaces often overlooked in lower-resolution models (Ossola et al. 2019), includes vertical complexity absent in typical two-dimensional analyses (Pretzsch et al. 2015), and represents geometries influencing ecological connectivity missing in coarse measures (Casalegno et al. 2017). These advances enable our scenarios to integrate nonhuman capabilities that may be unobvious in narratives based on written text or landscape-level analysis. Design researchers confirm the importance of improved resolution and volumetric focus Urech et al. 2020. For example, at year 30 in our positive scenario, high-resolution scans reveal that senescing elms provide 409,853m³ of dead branches and 1,198,359m³ of perch branches distributed across complex three-dimensional geometries. Traditional management focused on canopy cover metrics do not consider such resources.
Currently, we consider a limited subset of capabilities linked to arboreal habitat resources and focus on spatial dimensions. Future directions could incorporate other capabilities through analysis of sensory ecologies - for instance, subtle features like polarized light that influence habitat selection (Dyck 2012). Yet, the dangers of inappropriate quantification are significant. Reviews of AI approaches in urban forestry warn that biodiversity may be harmed by management approaches increasingly informed by standardized algorithms [REF]. More immediately, like-for-like quantities – as in offset programs replacing old trees with nest boxes or younger trees [REF] – can lead to the significant reduction of woodland capabilities when humans eliminate arboreal resources [REF].
The greatest risk comes from flattening nonhuman lives. Capabilities represent real opportunities for individuals or entities to achieve what they value. This framing reveals many forms of expression, from chemical scents to complex structures. Scientists understand that mature woodlands foster collaborations among trees, fungi, and birds, creating self-maintaining canopies full of microhabitats that demonstrate adaptability and memory (Ibarra et al., 2020). Such interconnected capabilities can help recast nonhumans from mute objects needing human advocates into active participants and experts (Disch, 2016). Recognizing these capabilities brings significant benefits: reducing urban forest extinction debts [REF], enhancing urban cooling [REF], and strengthening ecological communities' resilience to shocks [REF]. Rather than attributing human-like characteristics to material objects, this offers a methodological principle that can make visible varied agents and guide methods that can make visible their traces in structures.
6.2.2	Generation of Novel Scenarios
Going further, how might lizards, birds, and trees help design future cities? Consider the City site, where building envelopes become bioenvelopes. Figures 7 illustrate how green roofs, embedded features, and porous façades transform surfaces into walkable habitats. Lizard ladders, epiphytes, and strategically placed rocks create microclimates on building roofs and walls, enabling species to move upward, traverse neighbourhoods, and access new feeding and nesting areas.

Disuss how conventional frameworks would approach the City site
•	Ecological modeling would predict species decline
•	Ecosystem services would focus on human benefits like cooling
•	Wildlife-inclusive design would suggest innovative interventions but not those that might challenge human preferences, safety and comfort
Discuss the impacts of these conventional frameworks?
o	Well, 25-30 year timelines of ecosystem services not sufficient for staging sequencing. 
o	Human preferences include legitimate issues – such as sickness, and death – but also are very biased. The range is still so dominated by human interests. For instance, consider tree branch fall risk. Ecologists understand that there are many approaches to eliminate risk (such as creating habitat islands under tree canopies that mean humans do not walk there) – yet these are still rarely implemented. In a constrained site such as a city, with even more tradeoffs – this means proposals are always marginal, always insufficient. 
o	Some may argue against such interventions in highly modified environments, viewing artificial structures as inadequate substitutes for natural systems. While this perspective raises important concerns about authenticity and long-term viability, it underestimates the potential for designed elements to create meaningful connections between human and nonhuman communities. Well-conceived interventions can serve both as immediate ecological support and as catalysts for deeper understanding of multispecies needs.
Scenarios explcility considering nonhuman objectives incease the scope of consideration. Here,  in this City site vision, building surfaces—now bioenvelopes—serve as multi-level habitats. A rewilded laneway with amplified resources distributes shrubs, vines, nurse logs, and epiphytes. Heavy-load roofs can support mature vegetation; lightweight roofs hold dry debris, rocks, and smaller vegetation. The introduction of vertical lizard ladders facilitated by epiphytes and embedded footholds allows species to climb façades and reach expanded territories. Such outcomes would not be considered if the evaluation criteria were limited to humans.
The model's resistance analysis provides traceable, empirical basis for mapping where transformations can happen across the City site:
3.	Demonstrate the empirical rigor:
•	How resistance analysis determines valid locations
•	Structural/spatial constraints
•	Resource distribution calculations
4.	Compare outcomes with conventional approaches:
•	Increased resource volumes
•	Enhanced connectivity
•	Support for broader range of capabilities

Low Resistance Areas (maintaining human function):
•	Laneways and service corridors can host intensive biological activity while maintaining access
•	Lightweight rooftop installations can create new habitat connections without structural modifications
•	Building facades can support vertical habitat networks while preserving core building functions
High Resistance Areas (requiring functional change):
•	Heavy-load green roofs demanding significant structural modifications
•	Areas where human movement patterns would need to redirect
•	Spaces where accumulated biomass and deadwood challenge conventional maintenance



Refining these into design templates by interdisciplinary teams will be important for transitioning from theoretical to physical prototypes for monitoring and refinement. More-than-human extensions produce substantial benefits, as they sample the existing capabilities of a broader range of community members. For instance, trees provide structures, resist change, and encourage long-term planning. Architects can use the model to experiment with forms and materials while ensuring designs provide affordances like perches, nesting sites, and food sources. Planners can identify potential gains in the urban fabric, extending protocols such as the Biosensitive Urban Design protocol Garrard et al. 2018 with performance targets calibrated to reference woodlands. Lizards and birds can discover unexpected ways to use artificial structures, enabling iteration in design. These approaches demonstrate benefits by focusing on inviting more participants to express a broader range of capabilities, enriching the entire community.

Notions such as participatory or situated design recognize that design projects always involve heterogeneous stakeholders many of whom are not professional designers. These interpretations recognize contingent, emergent, and relational nature of design decisions and design outcomes. From the perspective presented in the previous section, there is no privileged view on design or its components. All stakeholders have views and all views are partial. Here, design is always a composite. In human scenario planning, research recognizes that increasing the diversity of this composite including non-professionals, can unblock decision-making and open up new solutions (Elsawah et al. 2020; Barendregt et al. 2024). Yet, current anthropocentric models rarely extend this inclusivity to nonhuman stakeholders.
By contrast, in this City site vision, building surfaces—now bioenvelopes—serve as multi-level habitats. A rewilded laneway with amplified resources distributes shrubs, vines, nurse logs, and epiphytes. Heavy-load roofs can support mature vegetation; lightweight roofs hold dry debris, rocks, and smaller vegetation. The introduction of vertical lizard ladders facilitated by epiphytes and embedded footholds allows species to climb façades and reach expanded territories. Such outcomes would not be considered if the evaluation criteria were limited to humans.

High Resistance Areas (requiring functional change):
•	Heavy-load green roofs demanding significant structural modifications
•	Areas where human movement patterns would need to redirect
•	Spaces where accumulated biomass and deadwood challenge conventional maintenance
The resistance mapping makes visible both immediate opportunities where ecological gains can happen with minimal disruption, as well as areas where achieving woodland capabilities necessarily requires more substantial transformation of human spaces and practices.

Lizard ladders, epiphytes, and strategically placed rocks create microclimates on building roofs and walls, enabling species to move upward, traverse neighbourhoods, and access new feeding and nesting areas. 

The key point is that the model provides traceable, empirical basis for determining where transformations can occur with minimal disruption versus where more substantial changes are needed. This allows for strategic implementation that builds trust through early wins in low-resistance areas before tackling more challenging transformations.



This scenario extends the modek yesy to simulate complex distributions of resources across building surfaces and vertical structures, going beyond ground-level interventions

Green indicates dense understory vegetation on structurally robust roofs that support heavier loads. Orange indicates nurse logs, rocks, and dry vegetation creating diverse microclimates on lightweight roofs. Yellow shows epiphytes and embedded features that facilitate lizard movement up building facades and across rooftops.

While the proposed changes require significant human compromise in aesthetics and access, progressive implementation allows communities to adapt while building evidence for broader transformation.

6.2.3	Considering Challenges

Can be slow, costly, significant changes to human aesthetics
Stakeholders might select things that do not work out in the end
*Some will argue that humans should stop interfering with others’ lives,
stressing that human-made habitats are band-aid solutions or last-resort
measures. This logic has merit but understates the value of human-made habitats
including bird houses and bee hotels as artefacts that can
enhance human knowledge about and emotional connections with other species.


Finally, can these approaches help navigate the challenge of designing more just futures? Such visions require confronting practices humans consider unjust, while acknowledging that addressing these injustices will be an ongoing process rather than a complete resolution. Tensions arise when different needs conflict - such as between current and future generations, or between individual and collective interests. More-than-human approaches must recognize that addressing these issues involves iterative processes rather than one-off solutions. However, resistance can emerge when proposed ideas fall too far outside societal norms, particularly when their benefits occur beyond human perceptual scales.
The Street site scenario illustrates these challenges by exploring expanded alternatives—such as distributing artificial trees along utility poles Figure 8. These structures can provide immediate habitat for epiphytes, insects, and birds, rather than waiting hundreds of years for natural development. However, human-made structures, while intended to benefit certain species, can create unexpected complications. For instance, nest boxes may alter birds' physiological responses and clutch sizes compared to natural hollows. In some cases, artificial habitats become ecological traps, attracting species without providing sustainable long-term support. Additionally, humans may resist such interventions as too unusual, costly, or visually disruptive, especially when they require counterintuitive limitations on human activities.

The volumetric distributions modelled provide a foundation for modelling the benefits of these expanded options, but they are currently schematic. The design interventions must consider practical implementation challenges. For example, existing council guidelines for climate-adapted tree plantings assume single-layer, ground-level installations Kendal & McDonnell 2014. Creating artificial canopies requires new considerations for three-dimensional spatial positioning across different heights. Additional factors include site-specific conditions, resistance to vandalism, structural integrity, and installation sequencing. 

 
Figure 8. Top. Artificial tree structures mounted on light poles along the main street, providing arboreal habitat resources in areas previously devoid of habitat where natural canopy was absent. Bottom: Comparison of resources between the artificial canopy system and newly planted saplings.
While ambitious and positive visions can build coalitions that might otherwise be discouraged by grim forecasts Wyborn et al. 2020, implementing such speculative visions requires careful explanation and community trust-building. The Three Horizons framework from transition science helps structure this progression from visionary thinking to practical change Sharpe et al. 2016. Beginning with existing infrastructure and social expectations Horizon 1, cities can pilot innovative ideas—like artificial canopies, epiphyte installations, and microhabitat features—within current systems Horizon 2. Through numerical modelling, evidence gathering, and integration with existing management practices, these innovations can gradually inform substantial transformation Horizon 3, where multispecies support becomes standard practice.

 
Figure 9. Potential implementation of artificial tree habitats on utility poles (highlighted in red). The sequence begins with pilot installations to build community acceptance, followed by gradual removal as natural trees mature and develop comparable arboreal resources over centuries.
This progression demands sustained effort and careful evaluation. Detailed modelling and incremental testing help communities assess intervention feasibility. Stylized visualizations enable more productive debates by acknowledging uncertainties rather than presenting misleading photorealistic predictions. Community engagement programs, such as Melbourne's Bioblitz, can involve residents in data collection for future models City of Melbourne 2012. While these approaches cannot guarantee universal acceptance, they provide frameworks for navigating tensions between competing interests and creating a common frame to explore evolving conditions.



7	Contribution to Knowledge [250, actual 230]
This article examines whether nonhuman contributions can generate urban scenarios unattainable through anthropocentric approaches. Through a case study of Melbourne's urban forest, we demonstrate how including nonhuman stakeholders in design processes can expand the possibilities for multispecies cities.
Our findings support all three components of our hypothesis. First, we show that incorporating nonhuman perspectives through the capabilities approach generates more ambitious outcomes than conventional mitigation strategies. Our positive scenario achieves a 60% increase in perching branches and 40% increase in hollows compared to current trajectories, while enabling natural woodland processes to re-emerge. Second, we demonstrate that these enhanced environments can be modelled within clear empirical constraints using volumetric analysis of arboreal resources and systematic evaluation of stakeholder capabilities. Third, we establish that detailed observations of nonhuman entities - from lizard movement patterns to tree senescence processes - can meaningfully inform scenario development and reveal overlooked opportunities in urban spaces.
These findings have important implications for urban designers, city planners, local governments, and conservation organizations. The framework provides practical tools for expanding stakeholder engagement, setting meaningful ecological targets, and evaluating design alternatives. While implementation requires significant changes to human aesthetics and urban functions, our results show how progressive implementation can build trust and evidence for broader transformation. By demonstrating how nonhuman contributions can inform more ambitious visions of multispecies cities, this research advances both theoretical understanding and practical approaches for urban transformation.
