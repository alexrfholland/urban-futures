1;JT;This study investigates the future of urban forests in Melbourne, Australia, focusing on large, old trees and their inhabitants. Climate change, aging populations of trees, and urban densification accelerate forest decline. Without mature trees, which take centuries to develop crucial features for habitat, wildlife populations face significant loss.;Needs to be condensed into 1 paragraph
1;JT;stakeholders and participants;is there a difference here?
1;JT;[Typically, no heading in the intro, and I would not use the standard headings such as 'gap'.];Introduction
1;JT;States;Which states?
1;JT;Yet, research on practices for transformative change lags behind that on the nature of the problems (Sharpe et al., 2016).;This sounds good but the sentence doesn't have any content because you are alluding to something that isn't then explained.
1;JT;Cities are critical sites for such transformation, concentrating both environmental impacts and opportunities for new relationships between human and nonhuman urban dwellers;this needs to be clearer - it is grammatically correct but it does not convey adequate meaning. Try to be more direct. Your words and sentences need to have meaning rather than a 'feeling' of what they mean.
1;JT;recogni[z]e [s];suggest changing everything to English English unless the Journal asks for US spelling.
2;PG;[no body text];Consider instead citing the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (CBD, 2022) in which the Parties to the convention on Biodiversity committed to reduce the impact of urbanisation on biodiversity and human wellbeing by 2030.
2;PG;States have pledged to achieve a vision of "Living in harmony with nature" by 2050 (IPBES, 2019). Multiple large-scale assessments show rapid environmental change means achieving such visions demands substantial changes in human and nonhuman individuals, institutions, societies, and cultures;Consider briefer here.
2;JT;classic habitat enhancement;what makes it 'classic'?
2;JT;involve complex power dynamics (Goodwin et al., 2022).;You are leaving sentences unfinished - the reader is needing to interpret what you mean. It's like someone asking you a question and you replying, "I just think that is interesting". Explain the nature of the power dynamics for the reader if you are going to mention them. Don't be mysterious.
2;JT;[While the future is unpredictable and stakeholder goals remain diverse, s [S]peculative visions serve as powerful tools for exploring potential trajectories through prototypes and scenarios, expanding the range of alternative outcomes while coordinating collective action (Edwards & Pettersen, 2023).];It's all a bit too dreamy and ethereal in the intro. Fact, fact, another fact, context, fact, context, hypothesis. Try to be more direct.
2;JT;design processes introduces complex ethical considerations (Parker, Soanes, et al., 2022).;This is another example of a sentence that leaves the reader hanging - what are the ethical considerations? You need to explain them if they are important. If you don't have room in the paper, delete it.
2;JT;Despite improved frameworks such as design for biodiversity, sustainability, and nature-based solutions, decision-making about desirable futures typically remains within human political forces and expertise. Scenario frameworks seeking to broaden urban futures acknowledge a gap in scenarios frameworks that value nonhuman lifeforms and ecosystems beyond human well-being, preferences and interest (Mansur et al., 2022);This can all be condensed and repeats information above.
2;JT;Lack of baselines;I think this is losing track for the reader on where you are going. It might be Ok to be saved for your thesis chapter but seems like a detour for the research and justification of the research. Optional delete.
2;JT;evolved histories;?
2;JT;change;Is this a change or interference?
2;JT;Futures studies increasingly recognises the need to develop communal imagination to think beyond prevailing narratives (Neuhoff et al., 2023). Recent large-scale efforts by the European Union and other institutions demonstrate benefits of empowering human communities in urban climate and energy transitions (Bresciani et al., 2024);repeats information above - need to combine / condense.
2;JT;For in stance, increasing proximity to nature can lead to conflicts between human communities and wildlife (Bhatia et al., 2020). Research into sensory and behavioural ecologies reveals how profoundly different nonhuman perspectives can be, potentially requiring significant changes to human aesthetic preferences and accepted risk levels.;You can combine / condense this information with that above - it will be clearer for a reader. Remember, it should have everything needed and nothing more.
3;PG;[no body text];It's not clear why this is relevant for your study.
3;JT;Multispecies futures must therefore develop communicative systems that empower the contributions of more-than-human collectives. While nonhumans cannot participate in traditional stakeholder workshops, some political theorists recognize that they can express agency through behaviours and signals (Disch, 2016). Numerical modelling offers practical pathways to connect these nonhuman signals with human institutions and design processes (Rutten et al., 2024). Yet models in current anthropocentric frameworks presume limited nonhuman capabilities and struggle to capture their contributions.;Limited stakeholder scope: You can combine / condense this information with that above - it will be clearer for a reader. Remember, it should have everything needed and nothing more.
3;JT;Computing can support numerical assessments of resulting alternatives.;need to better link 'computing' into the discussion of models and how they are generated.
3;JT;Our central hypothesis is: nonhuman contributions can generate scenarios which are unattainable to humans on their own.;this should be moved to the introduction, not in the methods. You may need to move this entire section to the introduction. At the end of the intro, you should come to a conclusion that leads you to generate a hypothesis. Your method then goes about how you will test the hypothesis.
3;JT;Originally developed for human development and later extended to animal welfare, this approach recognizes that considered entities require opportunities for fulfilling lives beyond economic indicators;This sort of information is 'given' based on your introduction and does not need to be repeated here. Just explain what you did, not why unless it is for technical clarification. The method is the 'recipe book', not the argument for why you are making the cake.
4;JT;The model also searches urban elements capable of improving arboreal habitat resources, implementing: Rewilding of larger ground areas, Translocating snags to provide vertical habitat structures, Extension of the model also consider deploying: Artificial trees on poles and streetlights. Bio-envelopes of rooftops and facades that can support lightweight and more intensive modifications. Sub-models simulate possible distributions and quantities of resources across trees of different ages, management impacts, and design supports.;too many dot-points for a journal - try to incorporate this information into paragraphs.
5;PG;3.3 Opportunity;Typically journal articles explain specific objectives or present questions here, so this would fit better here.
5;JT;[In the discussion, we evaluate the generative potential of this framework against others by comparing scenario-building teams, success criteria, ability to describe participants and conditions, and included time scales.];Don't signal, just do.
5;JT;Rather than using standard protocols designed to verify predictive power, we focus on examining the generative potential of the output scenarios. To do so, we perform an additional step and generate visualizations. These show specific points in time and space in the 'positive' scenario. These images help reduce uncertainty by making explicit predictions about how resources might be distributed within a transformed urban fabric. We compile these images using different techniques for generating structures and resources, each with distinct constraints and varying degrees of confidence regarding locations, boundaries, and quantities. To aid interpretation, we provide a table describing the ecological functions and underlying spatial constraint and uncertainties of different visual components in the images.;it is questionable whether this level of detail is required. I would encourage you to just 'do' the analysis rather than signal ahead of time - it should be reasonably obvious from your introduction. This text is kind of the thing that you might give a reviewer if they didn't understand why you did something.
5;JT;Table 3. Main and complementary scenarios. Complementary scenarios marked with *;Table is overkill when 1 sentence describing the 3 things that are not done would suffice.
6;PG;[no body text];Consider whether this is too Melbourne-centric for a broader (international?) audience.
6;JT;[We show outcomes for the main site in the results.];[no comment text]
6;JT;Section 2 develops scenarios that show how current and trending management practices at the site diminish woodland capabilities while also illustrating possibilities for restoring woodland capabilities through designs that go beyond current management strategies. Section 3 presents scenes that show instantiated perspectives going beyond conventional approaches.;Move these to the relevant sections. Again - don't tell, just do.
6;JT;these capabilities t;which capabilities?
7;PG;Arboreal resources linked to nonhuman stakeholders;be more specific about habitat resources rather than modelling
7;PG;Generated resistance scores under tree canopies and other urban elements that inform where and how design interventions can be implemented safely or practically;is it really clear?
7;PG;The model provides a spatially explicit framework to simulate above-ground arboreal habitat resources at any location in the City of Melbourne. It uses multi-resolution voxels to simulate distributions at woodland baselines, current site conditions, and future trajectories.;source? source of data?
7;PG;Trees can: Grow according to trunk growth rates;source?
7;PG;Trees approaching end of life expectancy enter senescence;source of data?
7;PG;Senescent trees either: Age-in-place if site resistance is low;I'm not sure this is realistic given exotic trees: (i) allow better solar access in winter (when the sun is low and they lose their leaves) (ii) provide better shade in summer
7;PG;Get replaced with young eucalyptus if site resistance is high;Eucalyptus (italicised)
7;PG;[no body text];and thus some mix of native/exotic is probably more acceptable
7;JT;try to move the images below some of the descriptive text so that the reader gets and introduction first before being hit with the image.;[no comment text]
7;JT;Trending;? Trending scenarios? Timeline scenarios? Analysis of timeline scenarios? Timeline analysis?
8;PG;Senescing trees may: Receive design supports, including: Ground depaving and the creation of under-canopy habitat islands in low resistance areas (ie, street parking, laneways, and median strips);I don't think you define 'resistance' nor explain how it is calculated and then used in modelling.
8;PG;The model also searches urban elements capable of improving arboreal habitat resources, implementing: Rewilding of larger ground areas;or you could give examples of where needed? what effective?
9;PG;[no body text];by 'epiphytes' do you mean mistletoe? (I couldn't follow modelling epiphytes).
9;PG;[no body text];mistletoe is a parasite so overtaking will kill the tree and only grows on eucalypts
9;JT;This sounds good but the sentence doesn't have any content because you are alluding to something that isn't then explained.;too many dot-points for a journal - try to incorporate this information into paragraphs.
10;PG;Our analysis considers a subset of capabilities related to niche and habitat. We focus specifically on above-ground arboreal habitat resources, considering resources as elements in an environment that a capability can convert into a benefit for an agent.;Can you be a little more succinct given you only model a subset of 'capabilities'?
10;PG;Data sources include urban forest inventories, GIS data (roads, footways, tramways, powerlines, building footprints), lidar for building envelopes and tree canopies, and estimates of precolonial baselines. High-resolution laser scans of elm and eucalyptus trees, ecological surveys, and custom implementations for branch detection and senescence simulation inform resource distribution.;[cannot translate]
10;PG;[no body text];make ref. ref. all specific species names must be italicised
10;JT;[Illustrative Visualisations];[no comment text]
10;JT;[To illustrate the transition from current conditions to the envisioned future, we present visualizations showing how resources interact and change over time.];[no comment text]
11;JT;[We continue with the discussion.];how is 'ambitious' defined?
11;JT;significant limitations:;limitations with respect to the study? If so, this should come as the penultimate section (or thereabouts) in the discussion.
12;PG;[no body text];This is part of 'model description'
12;JT;How might nonhuman stakeholders have a greater say in decision-making?;I feel like you are going backward and forwards here - this information should either be in the results or removed for another piece or discussed above the prior sections, which seemed to be getting to a conclusion. Remember - you are writing a paper, so it might be worth really trimming this down and leaving the remainder for your thesis.
13;PG;Model Output Verification [147 words];Does this section describe 'verification' or does it describe a range of scenarios for comparison?
13;PG;Validates our ability to accurately model current arboreal resource distributions;I don't think it does this
13;JT;Biases in [this] [such] translation are inevitable.;How could we know if they are outside human perception - are these known unknowns or unknown unknowns? You are kind of saying they are assumed unknowns? I thin this is a reach that goes beyond the scope of the paper.
14;JT;Finally, [can] these approaches help navigate the challenge of designing preferred futures [?][.];This is too vague.
17;PG;The tree persona exhibits continuous regeneration through overlapping lifecycles. The loamy soil provides plenty of opportunities for seedlings to sprout. A robust cohort of 2,014 saplings and 255 mid-phase trees ensures ongoing canopy renewal.;Here you model recruitment, needs to be included in a description of your model.
17;PG;The woodland bird persona benefits from extensive resources found in intact woodlands. Each large tree produces [x-x] number of hollows for nesting, 309‚Äì807m¬≤ of peeling bark forming sources of invertebrate prey, and 619‚Äì1,763m¬≤ of perching branches for observation and rest.;These are from what? What are these numbers based on?
18;PG;Both scenarios begin along a 500m stretch of Royal Parade, where intensive management of 40 mature elm trees prevents natural habitat development.;write for an international audience to describe this generally
19;PG;5.2.2 Trending;Summarising these results as figures would be good.
19;PG;The trending scenario considers outcomes if current management practices are continued.;This scenario wasn't described in Methods - they need to be consistent
19;PG;The positive scenario considers management practices and actions that enhance woodland capabilities.;This scenario wasn't described in Methods - they need to be consistent to be contrasted
19;PG;An artificial mistletoe program establishes [x] epiphytes. The overall look remains recognizably a street, but accumulated ground resources expand lizard habitat to 45% of the site, up from 15% in the trending scenario.;Is this feasible?
20;PG;At year 30, increased wildlife builds public trust, enabling two traffic lanes (3,000m¬≤) to be depaved. Twenty-five additional elms have entered late senescence, with 15 having died. Rather than being removed, 12 remain as standing snags (each 15-20m tall), providing approximately [x]m¬≤ of coarse woody debris (yellow canopies, Figure 3).;needs defining in methods
23;PG;[no body text];these relationships need to be defined in Methods. eg. what [cannot translate]
23;PG;Epiphytes (green);reconsider including mistletoe (a parasite that reduces the longevity of eucalypts)
26;PG;Our analysis reveals five significant limitations:;Usually you discuss these towards the end of this section, or raise them at pivotal places throughout this section.
28;PG;6.2 Designing beyond the status quo: directions for future research [1800, actual: 2089];again, usually this is the last item to discuss in this section
29;PG;For instance, male wall lizards mark favourable urban locations with femoral gland secretions, while blue-tongued skinks leave chemical trails to indicate preferred shelter sites. Yet this also presents challenges because humans must translate and interpret these expressions. Biases in this translation are inevitable.;you must cite a reference for statements such as this
32;PG;Human preferences, while including legitimate concerns about safety, injury, and death, remain heavily biased. For example, tree branch fall remains a risk, yet ecologists understand multiple approaches to eliminate it, such as creating habitat islands under tree canopies to redirect human movement;arborists
33;PG;Figure 9. Potential implementation of artificial tree habitats on utility poles (highlighted in red). The sequence begins with pilot installations to build community acceptance, followed by gradual removal as natural trees mature and develop comparable arboreal resources over centuries.;These figures would be more informative if focused on the same location for each time period. As currently illustrated you are confounding space + time.
37;PG;[no body text];Again, you are confounding space and time in these figures
